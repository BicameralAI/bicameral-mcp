# MCP Server — Claude Agent Instructions

## Canonical Skill Source

`pilot/mcp/skills/` is the **single canonical location** for all skill files in this project. Do not edit `.claude/skills/bicameral-*/SKILL.md` copies — they are stale duplicates and should be deleted. When a skill file changes, commit only the `pilot/mcp/skills/` version.

## Tool Changes Require Skill Changes (Mandatory)

Any change to an MCP tool's behavior — new fields in a response, new status values,
changed defaults, new tool calls, deprecated params — **must ship with a matching
update to the relevant `skills/*/SKILL.md`** in the same commit.

This is not optional. A tool change with no skill update is incomplete. The skill
is the contract between the server and the agent layer; breaking it silently is
worse than a compile error because it fails at runtime in production sessions.

**Checklist before marking a tool PR complete:**
- [ ] Did any response field change shape or gain a new value? → Update skill rendering section
- [ ] Did any default behavior change? → Update skill's "Steps" or "After" section
- [ ] Did a new tool get added? → Create `skills/<tool-name>/SKILL.md`
- [ ] Did a status literal gain a new value (e.g. `"proposal"`)? → Update every skill that renders status

## Sociable Testing for UX Paths (Mandatory for Handlers + Ledger)

Default to **sociable unit tests** ([Martin Fowler, "On the Diverse And Fantastical Shape of Testing"](https://martinfowler.com/articles/2021-test-shapes.html)) for anything the MCP agent actually invokes: handlers under `handlers/`, ledger queries in `ledger/`, and the contracts they return. A test is **solitary** when it replaces a collaborator we ship to users (the `ctx`, the `ledger`, a handler in the call graph) with a `MagicMock` / `AsyncMock` / `patch(...)`; it's **sociable** when it runs the real collaborator and only seams off something we genuinely can't run in tests (network, time, external SaaS, an injected failure mode like "symbol disappears").

The motivation is concrete: AI-authored tests skew solitary because mocks are easy to make pass. A solitary test for `get_session_start_banner` stayed green for months while `get_decisions_by_status` was selecting an undefined `decision_id` field and returning `None` for every banner row — agents saw null IDs in production while the suite reported full coverage. The first sociable run caught it.

**Rules**

1. **Handler tests** (`tests/test_<handler>*.py`) — instantiate a real `SurrealDBLedgerAdapter` over `memory://` and seed rows with the production schema. Reference pattern: `tests/test_codegenome_continuity_service.py::_fresh_adapter` and `tests/test_sync_middleware.py::_make_real_adapter`.
2. **Ledger query tests** — never `MagicMock` the client. Use the real `LedgerClient(url="memory://", ...)` + `init_schema` + `migrate`.
3. **`ctx` should be `SimpleNamespace`, not `MagicMock`** — when a handler grows a new required field, `SimpleNamespace` raises `AttributeError` and the test fails honestly; `MagicMock` silently invents the field.
4. **Narrow seams are fine** when the alternative is impossible or fragile: patching `ledger.status.resolve_symbol_lines` to simulate a missing symbol (`tests/test_link_commit_grounding.py:185`), patching `handle_link_commit` when testing the *caller's* cache logic (not link_commit itself), patching `time.monotonic` for TTL math.
5. **Solitary is correct for** pure helpers (`_check_payload_size` standalone), external boundaries we can't run (`tests/test_backends_google_drive_unit.py`), and concurrency primitives that don't talk to collaborators (`repo_write_barrier` tests).

**Checklist before opening a tests-only PR**

- [ ] Does the test instantiate `MagicMock` for `ctx` or `ledger`? → Replace with `SimpleNamespace` + real adapter unless one of the "solitary is correct" exceptions applies.
- [ ] Does the test hand-craft a row dict that mimics what the ledger returns? → Seed the real ledger and let it produce the row.
- [ ] Does an `assert_called_once_with(<exact SQL or arg list>)` mirror the production code? → That's a tautology. Replace it with an assertion on observable behavior (what the user/agent sees).
- [ ] Does the failure mode under test (e.g. symbol disappeared, ledger crashed) actually require a patch? → Yes is fine; pin the patch to the narrowest seam.

## Auto-Tick Rule

After completing **any** implementation work in this directory:
1. Open `TODO.md` — tick every item that is now done under **Engineering Progress**
2. Open `PLAN.md` — tick every phase item that is now done
3. If you replaced a mock with a real implementation, update `mocks/README.md`:
   - Move the entry from **Active Mocks** to **Replaced Mocks**
   - Record the date and what replaced it

Never mark something complete until the code is actually written and verified to import/run.

## SurrealDB Version — PINNED TO v2 (embedded via Python SDK)

**Critical for code generation**: All SurrealQL in this project targets SurrealDB **2.x embedded**
via the Python SDK (`surrealdb>=1.0.0`). Do NOT use v3 syntax.

| Feature | ✅ v2 (use this) | ❌ v3 (do NOT use) |
|---|---|---|
| Full-text search index | `SEARCH ANALYZER` | `FULLTEXT ANALYZER` |
| Connection URL | `surrealkv://path` or `memory://` | standalone server |
| Auth (embedded) | no signin needed for `memory://` | `signin()` required |

**Reference**: `ledger/schema.py` is the canonical source for all table/index definitions.
Ground any new SurrealQL against the patterns there — the `@0@` operator, `RELATE`, and
graph traversal (`->table->`) all behave identically to v3 except for FTS index syntax.

**Known v2 quirks** (documented so you don't re-discover them):
- `search::score(0)` always returns `0.0` in embedded mode — use presence in results as match signal
- `AS` alias is NOT supported inside graph traversal field selectors (e.g. `->code_region.{name AS n}`)
- `ORDER BY` requires the field to be explicitly in the SELECT list when other fields use function transforms
- `INFO FOR TABLE` returns empty in embedded mode (use schema.py as ground truth instead)

## Env Vars

| Var | Default | Effect |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `SURREAL_URL` | `surrealkv://~/.bicameral/ledger.db` | SurrealDB URL. Use `memory://` for tests (no persistence). |
| `REPO_PATH` | `.` | Path to the repo being analyzed |

## CI

Tests run via GitHub Actions on PRs to `main` (see `.github/workflows/test-mcp-regression.yml`).
All phases use real adapters with `SURREAL_URL=memory://` (embedded, in-process).
Results are uploaded as artifacts (JUnit XML + HTML reports) for qualitative review.
